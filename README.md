# arduino-usb-terminal 
 Terminal emulator for sending commands to Arduino via USB

 
 
 This app simplifies testing your Arduino components that work with direct usb commands by giving you the ability to send custom commands and view the returned message from your Arduino device.
 
 This is being done as a hobby, and for experimenting, so probably there might be some flaws; As an example, the vendor ID of Arduino is hardcoded to only work with Arduino devices, but this is my use case and please feel free to change it to match your needs.
 
 # Build and Run
 The app is available for free on Google Play Store (Arduino USB Terminal).
 Otherwise, you can clone the project and run it locally.
 Please read the **Sentry Reports** part on this page before running the project to avoid build failures.

 ## Current Features in the app:
 - #### Terminal Emulator
    A Simple terminal page which does what it is supposed to do interacting with an Arduino manually through the USB cable.

 ## Upcoming features:
- #### Remote Terminal Support using [P2P connections with Wi-fi Direct](https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/wifi-direct).

    This allows a second device to control the Arduino wirelessly. The first device which is connected to the Arduino via USB forwards the commands coming from the second device by Wi-Fi.
- #### JoyStick Page (Probably).
 
 ## Tests
 Unit Tests and Instrumentation tests are under construction.
 I am still making a decision between GitHub-CI, Circle-CI, or the Bitrise to be used.
 
 ## Sentry Reports
 The project uses Sentry for the crash reports, if this is not needed, you can remove the following line in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

 ```<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="@string/sentry_dsn" />```

 But if it is needed, you need to [create a Sentry dsn value](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/) to put under the following path:
 `app/src/main/res/values/api_keys.xml`
 The file contents might look like similar to this:
 ```
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <resources>
      <string name="sentry_dsn" translatable="false">YOUR_SENTRY_SPECIFIC_VALUE</string>
  </resources>
```
